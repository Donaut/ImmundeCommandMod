# ImmuneMod
 A simple Immune Mod


## Getting Started
1. You need to create a default server. [Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=445315496)
2. Download the precompiled mod binaries. [Download](https://github.com/Donaut/ImmuneCommandMod/releases)
3. Open the folder where your game was installed and navigate to the <b>Imune_Data\Managed</b> subfolder and just copy the downloaded file there.
4. Succes.

<b>PRO TIPS:</b>
Copy the original game files to a new folder. This way we don't need to reinstall the game if we want to switch back to the vanilla game.

You can modify the your config .bat file to get listed in the Game server menus.

A proper plugin system needs to be created so we can create mods in an easier way.
